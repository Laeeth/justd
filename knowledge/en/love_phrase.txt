I can't get enough of you
I can't get enough of your hugs and kisses
I can’t help falling in love with you over and over again
I care about you more than words can say
I cherish and adore you
I crave your touch/attention
I did not know it was possible to love so deeply until I met you
I don't know what I would do without you in my life
I don't need anyone else in my life
I don’t want to miss a moment with you
I fancy you
I feel like I am dreaming when I am with you
I give my heart to you
I have always loved you and will always love you
I have never been loved like this before
I have never experienced love like this before
I heart you
I long for your touch
I long to be close to you
I love the way you hold me
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you love me
I love the way you make me feel
I love you from head to toe
I love you in more ways than one
I love you with all my heart and soul
I miss you every minute we are apart
I need you in my life
I never want you to stop loving me
I promise radiant devotion
I promise to love you forever
I still get butterflies in my stomach
I trust you with all my heart
I want to be with you forever
I want to devote my life to you
I want to shower you with love
I will go to the ends of the world for you
I'd love to wake up next to you forever
I'll follow you anywhere
I'll love you forever
I'll love you till death, and then some
I'm not waiting for a knight in shining armor - mine has already arrived
I'm thrilled to be a part of your life
I've been head over heels for you since day one
a day without you is like a day without sunshine
a love to last the ages
a match made in heaven
accept this as an expression of my love
always and forever
at last I have found you
being with you is a wish come true
being with you is a wonderful feeling
do you think of me as much as I think of you?
ever since I met you
every beat of my heart
every day I fall more in love with you
every day is a chance to celebrate our love
for the first time in my life _ true love
from your looks to your intellect, I love every part of you
how did a guy like me end up with a princess like you?
how do I love thee? Let me count the ways
how sweet it is to be loved by you
if this isn't love, I don't know what is
in your arms I am happy
it's a love thing
it's the little things you do
je t'aime
just being with you is enough for me to have a great time
let's make it last
life has never been better since you came into my life
love fills the smallest moment with a world of happiness
love is a friendship set to music
love is a gift tied with heartstrings
love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
love makes the world go round
love me tender
love puts a twinkle in your eye and a smile in your heart
love sweet love
loving you has been the best thing to ever happened to me
loving you is easy
loving you is natural
marry me and make me the happiest man alive
my heart beats your name
my heart is a-flutter
my heart leaps for you
my innermost thoughts and secrets
my life is empty without you
my lonely days are over
my love for you will never grow old
my love has come along
my sweet, embraceable you
now and forever
only you
our bond has grown even stronger
our love is so bright, I gotta wear shades
our love is special
please be always by my side
please take my heart
putting my heart on the line
sealed with a kiss
set the stage for romance
so glad I found you
so grateful to have you in my life
still devoted as I was on day one
still in love
still making music together
still the best thing that ever happened to me
thank you for all you have done for me
the sky's the limit when your heart is in it
the true measure of love is to love without measure
the very sight of you sets my heart beating
the words "I love you" are not enough to express how I feel about you
there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
these are words from the heart
this is a fairytale/legendary romance
this is a love to believe in
to love and be loved in return
to love is to receive a glimpse of heaven
today, tomorrow, and always
true love is a gift
two hearts that became one
unlucky in life but lucky in love
walking with you through life
we are connected in each other's thoughts and hearts
we are going to live happily ever after
we are made for each other
we are on a wonderful journey together
we are perfect together
we have a love built to last
we make a great team
we may not have it all together, but together we have it all
we share an intimate bond
we'll stick together through thick and thin
we're a perfect match
we're a perfect fit
we're bound to each other by love and friendship
when I'm not with you all I do is think about you
where would I be without you?
with every beat of my heart
xoxo
you are as beautiful as the day we met
you are beautiful on the inside and out
you are more than enough for me
you are my partner, lover, and best friend
you are the bacon to my eggs
you are the cream to my coffee
you are the jelly to my peanut butter
you are the milk to my cookie
you are the smile to my face
you bring out the best in me
you cast a spell on me
you complete me
you don't have to say a word for me to feel your love
you drive me wild
you fill my life with happiness
you ignite the passions
you know me inside and out
you make me a better person
you make me feel like I am the luckiest girl/guy in the world
you make me feel so special
you make me laugh
you make my soul blossom
you take my breath away
you took my hand, opened my mind, and touched my heart
you touch me deeply without even trying
you're everything I ever wanted and more
you're just so lovable
you're my favorite person
you're my first, my last, my everything
you're one of those special people who make life worth living
you're the best break this old heart has ever had
you're the light of my life
you're the one who holds the key to my heart
you're too good to be true
